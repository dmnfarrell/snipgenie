As this ORF has a RBS and transcriptional start immediately following the stop of the upstream ORF,it is possible that they are expressed as two separate modules. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain CDC1551, aceA exists as a single gene, MT1966: the corresponding protein has been purified experimentally and seems have an active isocitrate lyase activity (see Honer et al., 1999). For Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv, immunoblot assay didn't detect AceAa or AceAb products (see Honer et al.,1999) but mRNA of AceAa|Rv1915 has been detected (see Betts et al., 2002); so AceAb|Rv1916 could be a pseudogene. Icl2 has 2-methyl-isocitrate lyase (MCL) activity in M. tuberculosis Erdman (See Munoz-Elias et al., 2006)."
