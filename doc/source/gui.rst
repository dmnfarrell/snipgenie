Desktop Application
===================

The graphical user interface is designed for those not comfortable with the command line
and includes some additional features. It requires the installation of either PyQt5 or PySide2
if using the pip install. A windows installer for this application will be available separately.

Current features include:

* Simple fastq quality analysis
* View read alignments
* Phylogenetic tree viewing
* Contamination checker
